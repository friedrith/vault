  Vault
</h1>

The true and honest vault to save everything that matters for you.

Vault is a information system designed to store confidential passwords and other
texts. It is based on a double security: Google Drive hosting and a second
layer of encryption. Only you know the passphrase to unlock the second layer.
Besides, the encryption is performed on your computer so neither Google neither
Vault team can access your clear data.

If you are not sure you can assess the code of the repository. Everything used
to store your content is in this repository. Except requests related to download
and upload on/from Google Drive, Vault doesn't perform any other http requests.
